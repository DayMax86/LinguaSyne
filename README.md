# LinguaSyne
LinguaSyne is a language-learning Android app that uses a spaced repetition system (SRS) and mnemonics to help users remember vocabulary. The app currently teaches and tests users on French terms. It is designed to help those with little-to-no knowledge of the French language pick up some basic vocabulary in a natural and intuitive way.

The app uses the following features of modern Android development:
- Full MVVM architecture with complete separation of visual and data elements
- Jetpack Compose for all visual elements
- API calls using Retrofit
- Coroutines for asynchronous server requests
- Firebase integration: storing user and language data on firestore database, account data using authentication, and images using storage
- Material themes and string resources allowing for easy changes to appearance and language

The entire code is available to view here on GitHub so please feel free to browse!
