# LinguaSyne
LinguaSyne is a WIP language-learning app that uses an SRS (Spaced Repetition System) and mnemonics to help users remember vocabulary and phrases. The app is being developed with French as the language to learn, but is designed in a way that other languages can be added in the future.

The app uses the following features of modern Android development:
- Jetpack Compose (all visual elements are made using composable functions)
- API calls using Retrofit
- Firebase integration for user accounts and language data
- Full MVVM architecture
- Unit testing
- and more...
