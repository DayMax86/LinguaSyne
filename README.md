# LinguaSyne
LinguaSyne is a WIP language-learning app that uses an SRS (Spaced Repetition System) and mnemonics to help users remember vocabulary and phrases. The app is being developed with French as the language to learn, but hopefully it will be the first language of many!

To-do list:
- Create 'revision' sessions, where the user is tested on vocab they have been 'taught' in the lessons.
- Allow the user to level up items of vocab
- Implement SRS framework

Minor to-do items
- Fix top of screen being whited-out in dark mode
