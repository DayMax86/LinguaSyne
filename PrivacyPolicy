LinguaSyne Privacy Policy:

LinguaSyne was built as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.
This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

Information Collection and Use

To use the Service, you will be required to share your email address in order to create an account. Account authentication is handled by Google's Firebase service
meaning your password cannot be seen by anyone and is fully encrypted. I, the developer, am able to see your email address, and if you choose to upload a profile image 
(not doing so does not affect functionality of the app) I will have access to view said image. No other personal data is collected, used or handled by LinguaSyne.

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
that these external sites are not operated by me.
Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
services.

Childrenâ€™s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
I do not knowingly collect personally
identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
I discover that a child under 13 has provided
me with personal information, I immediately
delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
and you are aware that your child has provided us with
personal information, please contact me so that
I will be able to do the necessary actions.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from
time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
periodically for any changes. I will
notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
